### Intro
The Floating city of Volantis is a freehold city located on the highest point in [[The Mannito]] Mountain range. The old capital of the kingdom of ranor, the city is now ruled by the [[asfari syndicate]] 

A city divided into many self contained floating sections, volantis was the centre of innovation and trade before the rise of the arcane. It is now but a shell of its former glory, a city clinging to its past.
