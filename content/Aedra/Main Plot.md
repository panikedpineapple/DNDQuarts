>I still remember when the world was whole.  I remember the oceans, the smell of salt in the air. Before the vile magics the old ones corrupted the very fabric of reality, rending it asunder. I look at the new world and all I see is despair and pain. Time will heal these wound, and the young ones will forget what once was and what was lost. Magic is waning, I fear I might be the last.

The world was split apart due to the events of [[Aedra/Events/The Sundering]] a thousand years ago. All that remains of the world is [[Elaria]], a small country left floating the the nothingness.  The world was cut off from all forms of the divine . magic/divine interference/demons, None of that existed.  A Thousand year of peace that followed allowed the world to recover and rebuild. Billions of souls lost to the void that surrounds the nation. The Knowledge of magic lost as a result.

The knowledge of the tragedy, the utter devastation that followed, united the land and all its residents to come together and rebuild in peace. As the memories faded and the scars were healed, the greed begun to creep in again. Tensions between the races would continue to rise and all it would take to ignite was but a spark. A spark of magic. No one knows how or why the world began opening again, but it all started a few decades ago with the advent of magic.


 we don't know what exactly happened to bring it back, but  some individuals emerged the ability to use magic and quickly amassed power and influence. They gathered followers, called them their "family" and bestowed them the blessing of magic. Now they are known as the  [[Aedra/Factions/Asfari Syndicate]], the aboslute authority in Elaria.
