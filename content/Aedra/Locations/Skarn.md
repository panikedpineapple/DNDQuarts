Also known as the golden city, Skarn is the current seat of power of the [[Aedra/Factions/NightSilver|NightSilvers]]. It is a tiered city with free flowing rivers of yellow gold wastewater from the paper processing. Surrounded by the golden trees of the [[Singing Grove]] and enveloped by the sulphuric mists, the title of the golden city has changed meanings over the years.

Founded as a collection of paper mills adjacent to the [[Evergreen Wilds]], the city grew with the rise of the [[Jade Sentinals]] and was the site of the [[Blue Glass Rebellion]]. With the fall of the Sentinels after the events of  [[Aedra/Events/The Green Nightmare|The Green Nightmare]], Skarn was governed by the [[Flying Menece]] until the fall of the kingdom, at which point they were driven away by the syndicate.

Historically was the major administrative and mercantile centre in [[Aedra/Factions/Kingdom of Ranor|Kingdom of Ranor]]. Contains the mints that produce the currencies of the free cities and the [[Principality of Atraxia]].
