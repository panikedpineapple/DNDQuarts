The period before the sundering was marred by a global war, between [[the primal dieties]] and the invading [[Zagmer]] pantheon.Hundreds of years of constant warfare between these magnificent powers left the world a broken place, barely habitable by the native races.

On the verge of extinction, a champion of the [[the primal dieties]] was entrusted with the mission to create a safe haven for all races, a land without war. 

Thus the land of elaria was born, a land named after the champion [[Aedra/NPC/slyvia elar]] . But the gods were betrayed by their champion. The land meant to be a safe haven for all was ripped from the world it was meant to save, left void of magic and blocked from the eyes of the gods.
