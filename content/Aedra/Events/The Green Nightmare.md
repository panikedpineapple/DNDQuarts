The [[Jade Sentinals]] managed to maintain peace with their martial might for well over three centuries. They created a dream of a peaceful haven to all beings, a place of equality and abundance, a bastion of innovation and learning.  

After the [[Blue Glass Rebellion]], local police forces of each kingdoms were absorbed by the sentinals. This duty in particular fell to the [[Lionheart Tribunal]] , the third wing of the sentinals.

On the third moon of the year 465 A.E , the first commander of the tribunal was defeated in a Blood Battle and replaced by the winner [[Sugon Lionheart]] . That is when the dream turned into a living nightmare. The tribunal took over supply routes between cities, taxed the villages beyond reason and razed opposing cities to the ground. They engineered famines and committed genocides.

The remaining wings of the sentinels were no match for the warfare that the tribunal waged. They embodied strength and lived for a good fight, but they were also honourable. And the tribunal knew all their methods and tactics. It was a futile effort and they were swiftly crushed.

One by one , the kingdoms fell to their might. It was only the fairy city of [[The floating lights]] that was the last bastion of hope and a refuge to all. The dangers of the [[Singing Grove]] made a siege almost impossible. The Tribunal had won.

With no common enemy to fight, the tribunal turned feral. The greed of all commanders tore themselves apart. Over the next few years, wars between city commanders was a common sight. In the end they could not hold onto the power they had won in blood of innocents and the tribunal fell apart. This weakened shell could not defend itself when the [[Flying Menace]] attacked and ended the nightmare by installing the rightful rulers back to their thrones.
