After the disappearance of [[Aedra/NPC/slyvia elar|Slyvia Elar]] in the year 94 A.S, The kingdom fell into chaos of war between her two daughters vying for the control over the land. The two factions warred for the better part of a decade, laying waste to all that was rebuilt over the last century.

Fearing extinction, the [[Four Pillars]] rose up in revolt and forced a lasting truce. The kingdom was divided into two, the  [[Aedra/Factions/Kingdom of Ranor]], to be ruled by the elder daughter [[Ryhlla]] , and [[Principality of Atraxia]], led by the the younger [[Aenar]]. 

A council of warriors was created to oversee this truce. [[Jade Sentinals]] protected the truce  for decades.
