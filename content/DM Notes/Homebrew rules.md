# General

- A healing potion can be consumed within a bonus action or action. On a bonus action the player rolls for hp healed, or they can take an action and heal as if they rolled max for the potion. Administering to others is a full Action.
- __Initiative__: Players with the same initiative roll go at the same time. They can coordinate and plan and team-up, have actions go between each other etc. If you roll the same initiative as an enemy, the enemy always goes last, no dex checks required.
- __Flanking__: You get a +2 to attack rolls when flanking. However, units with passive perception of 18 or above cannot be flanked. This also applies to anything with blindsight or creatures that can realistically see in multiple directions(like beholders).
-  __Spells and Exhaustion__: 
	-  Exhaustion is on a scale of 1-10, with each level of exhaustion giving a stacking -1 to all D20 rolls and spell save DC. Going above 10 exhaustion leads to instant death.
	- Spells can still be used after expending spell slots. Each spell cast this way gives exhaustion equal to the spell level. For example, a 5th level spell would give 5 levels of exhaustion
- Ability checks and assistance: You cannot assist in ability checks that you don't have proficiency in.
