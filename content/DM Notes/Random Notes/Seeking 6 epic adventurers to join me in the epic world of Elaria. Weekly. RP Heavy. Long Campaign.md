## Intro

Greetings dungeoneers of r/LFG! I am Amber and I am looking for 6 heroic and creative adventures to join me in the massive world of Elaria, a world being meticulously handcrafted for the past year. 

We will be playing _EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND(either Saturday or Sunday or both as per the players discretion)_ except emergencies/holidays with a schedule made in advance by the players. The length of session and time will be decided later with the consent of all players.

We will be using ***Discord*** for **Voice and Video**  and **TablePlop** for **Battle Maps**

I hope to create a grand-scale campaign with compelling storytelling, layered political intrigue and conspiracy and a world built around player interaction where you decide where the story goes. I merely created the world, but you are the ones living it and deciding it's direction.


# Application Process

- Be prepared to go through multiple "interviews" and chats to make sure you are a good fit for both me and the group.
- Please fill out the application form at the end of the post. I will do my best to reach out as soon as possible.

# Requirements 

- **You must be 21 years of age or older**
	- This is a requirement due to the theme of this campaign touching upon subjects that might not be appropriate for younger audiences. 
-  **You must have a PC or a Laptop**
	- Phones/tablets are not acceptable as your main device
-  **You must have a good quality headphone and mic**
	- While a dedicated mic is not required, a clear mic is a must.
-  **You must have a webcam**
	- I strongly believe that without the ability to see each other, we lose a lot of what makes d&d so much fun.
	- You will be required to have your webcam active at every session

# Playstyle

- **Roleplay Heavy** : About 75-25 
-  **Immersion** : Down to every last drop of ale, the scent of sweat and filth in the dungeons and forming real relationships with your fellow characters
	- You must be willing to immerse yourselves into the world. No Hack and slash.
- **Milestone Levelling**
- **No restriction on homebrew**  :  within reason of course. You can reach out to me anytime outside of sessions to discuss anything you want to do and figure out a way to accomplish that
-  **No pulling punches** : I don't like to pull punches with my players. The adventures will be deep, confusing, convoluted. There is no signposts on where to go next, no tutorial and no "take-backs". Actions have consequences, sometimes hilarious ,sometimes deadly.  It is up to you as a group to navigate them however you desire. Same goes for combat. And I don't mean it in a "haha - I love killing my players" way, but combat will be intense and strategic. 

# What is expected of You:

- **Be more than just a player**: You have to be an active member of the group. If you are looking to just show up to sessions, only do what is "required" and leave immediately when session ends to never be seen again until next session, this is not the table for you.
- **Honesty** : I require everyone to have integrity not only towards the group, but for themselves. Scheduling, personal issues or anything in between.
- **Be present** : Players are for participating. You must be willing to actively participate in the game. you cannot just sit back and listen.  

# A little about me:

Hi! My name is Amber (26M). I discovered D&D stuck in my room during the pandemic, and it has quickly become one of my biggest hobbies.  While I am not new to the game,  I am new to DM'ing a campaign of this size. After having practised with a few one-shots, I feel ready to dive into a project such as this.

I enjoy listening to others' ideas and learning. I always strive to provide equal opportunity to my players to let their voices be heard. I am an avid gamer. I love spending hours with my players, theory crafting backstories and tying the characters to the world and creating a campaign that reflects those players. 

I have been working on this work for the past year and now I am ready to invite you to be a part of this and share my love of worldbuilding and storytelling with you all.
