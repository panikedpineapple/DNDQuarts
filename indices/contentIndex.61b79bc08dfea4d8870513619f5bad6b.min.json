I remember the oceans, the smell of salt in the air. Before the vile magics the old ones corrupted the very fabric of reality, rending it asunder. I look at the new world and all I see is despair and pain. Time will heal these wound, and the young ones will forget what once was and what was lost. Magic is waning, I fear I might be the last. \n\u003e\n\u003e- From the \"New World Order\" by Sylvester Elar \n\n^5f2f15\n\n\nThe world was split apart due to the events of [[The Sundering]] a thousand years ago. All that remains of the world is [[Elaria]], a small country left floating the the nothingness.  The world was cut off from all forms of the divine . magic/divine interference/demons, None of that existed.  A Thousand year of peace that followed allowed the world to recover and rebuild. Billions of souls lost to the void that surrounds the nation. The Knowledge of magic lost as a result.\n\nThe knowledge of the tragedy, the utter devastation that followed, united the land and all its residents to come together and rebuild in peace. As the memories faded and the scars were healed, the greed begun to creep in again. Tensions between the races would continue to rise and all it would take to ignite was but a spark. A spark of magic. No one knows how or why the world began opening again, but it all started a few decades ago with the advent of magic.\n\n\n we don't know what exactly happened to bring it back, but  some individuals emerged the ability to use magic and quickly amassed power and influence. They gathered followers, called them their \"family\" and bestowed them the blessing of magic. Now they are known as the  [[asfari syndicate]], the aboslute authority in Elaria. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.559598675Z","tags":[]},"/Aedra/World":{"title":"World","content":" twin kingdoms of ranor and polis\nranor split into city states and polis is now in a lot of trouble.

This duty in particular fell to the [[Lionheart Tribunal]] , the third wing of the sentinals.\n\nOn the third moon of the year 465 A.E , the first commander of the tribunal was defeated in a Blood Battle and replaced by the winner [[Sugon Lionheart]] . That is when the dream turned into a living nightmare. The tribunal took over supply routes between cities, taxed the villages beyond reason and razed opposing cities to the ground. They engineered famines and committed genocides.\n\nThe remaining wings of the sentinels were no match for the warfare that the tribunal waged. They embodied strength and lived for a good fight, but they were also honourable. And the tribunal knew all their methods and tactics. It was a futile effort and they were swiftly crushed.\n\nOne by one , the kingdoms fell to their might. It was only the fairy city of [[The floating lights]] that was the last bastion of hope and a refuge to all. The dangers of the [[Singing Grove]] made a siege almost impossible. The Tribunal had won.\n\nWith no common enemy to fight, the tribunal turned feral. The greed of all commanders tore themselves apart. Over the next few years, wars between city commanders was a common sight. In the end they could not hold onto the power they had won in blood of innocents and the tribunal fell apart. This weakened shell could not defend itself when the [[Flying Rebels]] attacked and ended the nightmare by installing the rightful rulers back to their thrones.","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]},"/Aedra/notes/The-Mannito":{"title":"The Mannito","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]},"/Aedra/notes/The-Sundering":{"title":"The Sundering","content":"The period before the sundering was marred by a global war, between [[the primal dieties]] and the invading [[Zagmer]] pantheon.Hundreds of years of constant warfare between these magnificent powers left the world a broken place, barely habitable by the native races.\n\nOn the verge of extinction, a champion of the [[the primal dieties]] was entrusted with the mission to create a safe haven for all races, a land without war. \n\nThus the land of elaria was born, a land named after the champion [[slyvian elar]] .

Weekly. RP Heavy. Long Campaign","content":"\n## Intro\n\nGreetings dungeoneers of r/LFG! I am Amber and I am looking for 6 heroic and creative adventures to join me in the massive world of Elaria, a world being meticulously handcrafted for the past year. \n\nWe will be playing _EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND(either Saturday or Sunday or both as per the players discretion)_ except emergencies/holidays with a schedule made in advance by the players. The length of session and time will be decided later with the consent of all players.\n\nWe will be using ***Discord*** for **Voice and Video**  and **TablePlop** for **Battle Maps**\n\nI hope to create a grand-scale campaign with compelling storytelling, layered political intrigue and conspiracy and a world built around player interaction where you decide where the story goes. I merely created the world, but you are the ones living it and deciding it's direction.\n\n\n# Application Process\n\n- Be prepared to go through multiple \"interviews\" and chats to make sure you are a good fit for both me and the group.\n- Please fill out the application form at the end of the post. I will do my best to reach out as soon as possible.\n\n# Requirements \n\n- **You must be 21 years of age or older**\n\t- This is a requirement due to the theme of this campaign touching upon subjects that might not be appropriate for younger audiences. \n-  **You must have a PC or a Laptop**\n\t- Phones/tablets are not acceptable as your main device\n-  **You must have a good quality headphone and mic**\n\t- While a dedicated mic is not required, a clear mic is a must.\n-  **You must have a webcam**\n\t- I strongly believe that without the ability to see each other, we lose a lot of what makes d\u0026d so much fun.\n\t- You will be required to have your webcam active at every session\n\n# Playstyle\n\n- **Roleplay Heavy** : About 75-25 \n-  **Immersion** : Down to every last drop of ale, the scent of sweat and filth in the dungeons and forming real relationships with your fellow characters\n\t- You must be willing to immerse yourselves into the world. No Hack and slash.\n- **Milestone Levelling**\n- **No restriction on homebrew**  :  within reason of course. You can reach out to me anytime outside of sessions to discuss anything you want to do and figure out a way to accomplish that\n-  **No pulling punches** : I don't like to pull punches with my players. The adventures will be deep, confusing, convoluted. There is no signposts on where to go next, no tutorial and no \"take-backs\". Actions have consequences, sometimes hilarious ,sometimes deadly.  It is up to you as a group to navigate them however you desire. Same goes for combat. And I don't mean it in a \"haha - I love killing my players\" way, but combat will be intense and strategic. \n\n# What is expected of You:\n\n- **Be more than just a player**: You have to be an active member of the group. If you are looking to just show up to sessions, only do what is \"required\" and leave immediately when session ends to never be seen again until next session, this is not the table for you.\n- **Honesty** : I require everyone to have integrity not only towards the group, but for themselves. Scheduling, personal issues or anything in between.\n- **Be present** : Players are for participating. You must be willing to actively participate in the game. you cannot just sit back and listen.  \n\n# A little about me:\n\nHi! My name is Amber (26M). I discovered D\u0026D stuck in my room during the pandemic, and it has quickly become one of my biggest hobbies.  While I am not new to the game,  I am new to DM'ing a campaign of this size. After having practised with a few one-shots, I feel ready to dive into a project such as this.\n\nI enjoy listening to others' ideas and learning. I always strive to provide equal opportunity to my players to let their voices be heard. I am an avid gamer. I love spending hours with my players, theory crafting backstories and tying the characters to the world and creating a campaign that reflects those players. \n\nI have been working on this work for the past year and now I am ready to invite you to be a part of this and share my love of worldbuilding and storytelling with you all.\n\n# Application\n\n**If this sounds interesting to you and something you would like to be a part of, please fill out the application form below**\n\nAll communication will be through discord. Please leave a reply on this post after submitting your application.\n\n[Application Link](https://forms.gle/kpiFS22zhr3k6Uxf6)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]},"/DM-Notes/Random-Notes/Session-0-checklist":{"title":"Session 0 checklist","content":"/\nThis is just plans/framework/foundation for the campaign because we call know plans rarely work out once the campaign begins and this will hopefully make it easier to come to resolutions when dealing with these changes\n\n\n## things we discussed\n\n-late : 30 min\n- sex stuff/ rape\n- ","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]},"/DM-Notes/Tips/Session-0":{"title":"Session 0","content":"Running good session 0 is very important(before creating campaign and characters).\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]},"/DM-Notes/Tips/interview-things":{"title":"interview things","content":"\n#8 : rasmus/ eddydantes- male, 25, cet, saturday, \\\n#11 jonas - male, 22, cet, saturday\n#19 crow- male- 26- cet - saturday\n#26 henry - male - 21- cet- no pref\n#45 happi - 35- male- est - sat night or sundat\n#14\n#17\n#36\n#6 \n----\n2m 1 f\n#40 f - new\n#38 f\n\n\nmales\n32\n36/14","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]},"/DM-Notes/Tips/videos":{"title":"videos","content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuxPLNb4eA4\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-06T09:22:52.56359883Z","tags":[]}}
